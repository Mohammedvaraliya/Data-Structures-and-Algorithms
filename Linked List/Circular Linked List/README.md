# Circular Linked List Data-Structures and Algorithms

## 01. Circular Linked Lists -- Append and Prepend

    Circular Linked List append and prepend method
    Append - Add the Node from end of list
    Prepend - Add the Node from front of the list

## 02. Circular Linked Lists -- Remove Node

    Circular Linked Lists -- Remove Node
    It will remove the Node from the list

---

---

## 03. Circular Linked Lists -- Split List

    Circular Linked Lists -- Split List
    It will split the Circular Linked List into two Circular Linked List

## 04. Circular Linked Lists -- Josephus Problem

    Circular Linked Lists -- Josephus Problem
    Josephus problem will remove every node from the given Circular Linked List of the given step until only one Node left in the list

    Example:

    Circular Linked List :
                            1
                            2
                            3
                            4
                            5
                            6

    step = 2

    so the step start from head of the list

    2 is Node where step meet
    remove : 2

    4 is Node where step meet
    remove : 4

    6 is Node where step meet
    remove : 6

    since, it is cicular linked list it will circular again and remove the step Node until only one Node left

    3 is Node where step meet
    remove : 3

    Only one Node left : which is 5

## 05. Circular Linked Lists -- Is Circular Linked List

    Circular Linked Lists -- Is Circular Linked List

    It will check the list which is given is circular or not

    we can check this by giving Singly and Doubly linked list to verify Circular Linked List
