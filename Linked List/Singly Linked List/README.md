# Singly Liked List Data-Structures and Algorithms

## 01. Singly Liked List

    Singly Liked List
    Append - Add the Node from end of the list
    Prepend - Add the Node from front of the list

## 02. Singly Linked Lists -- Length of List

    Singly Linked Lists -- Length of List
    It will return the length of the Singly Linked List

    Example:
    Singly Linked List:
                        "A"
                        "B"

                        "D"

    length of Singly Linked List is : 4

## 03. Singly Linked Lists -- Node Swap

    Singly Linked Lists -- Node Swap
    It will swap the node from Singly Linked List

## 04. Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```bash
Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse
It will reversed the Singly Linked List

Example:
        "A"
        "B"
        "C"
        "D"
        "E"

reversed_list :
                "E"
                "D"
                "C"
                "B"
                "A"

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## 05. Singly Linked Lists -- Merge Two Sorted Lists

    Singly Linked Lists -- Merge Two Sorted Lists

            1

    After removing the duplicate Node from the Singly Linked list
    Singly Linked List will be:
                                1
                                2
                                7

## 07. Singly Linked Lists -- Nth-to-Last Node

    Singly Linked List -- Nth-to-Last Node
    It will return the Node from last index number.

## 10. Singly Linked Lists -- Is Palindrome

    Singly Linked Lists -- Is Palindrome
    A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forward and backwards.

    Example:

    RACEDAR can be same when read forward and backwards so this will return True.

    Example:
            H
            E
            L
            L
            O

    HELLO cannot be read be same when read forward and backwards so this will return False.

## 11. Singly Linked Lists -- Move Tail to Head

    Singly Linked Lists -- Move Tail to Head
    It will move the last node to head of the Singly Linked list.

    Example - singly LL is :
                            A
                            B
                            C
                            D
                            E
                            F

    Ater move tail to head :
                                F
                                A

                                E

## 12. Singly Linked Lists -- Sum Two Lists

    Singly Linked Lists -- Sum Two Lists

    llist 1 :
            3
            6
            5

            and

    llist 2 :
            2
            4
            8
