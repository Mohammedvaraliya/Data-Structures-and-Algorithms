## 04. Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```bash
Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse
It will reversed the Singly Linked List

Example:
        "A"
        "B"
        "C"
        "D"
        "E"

reversed_list :
                "E"
                "D"
                "C"
                "B"
                "A"

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## 06. Singly Linked Lists -- Remove Duplicates

    Singly Linked Lists -- Remove Duplicates
    It will remove the duplicate Node from the Singly Linked List

    Example:
            1

            7
            2
            1
            7
            1

    After removing the duplicate Node from the Singly Linked list
    Singly Linked List will be:
                                1
                                2
                                7

## 07. Singly Linked Lists -- Nth-to-Last Node

    Singly Linked List -- Nth-to-Last Node
    It will return the Node from last index number.

    Example:
            A
            B
            C
            D
            E
            F

    print_nth_from_last_method2(3):
                                    D

            4
            1
            2

    count_occurences_iterative(1):
                                    4

    because 4 occurences of Node with data (1) available in the Singly Linked List

## 09. Singly Linked Lists -- Rotate

    Singly Linked Lists -- Rotate
    It will rotate the Singly linked List of given index number.

    Example:
            1

## 10. Singly Linked Lists -- Is Palindrome

    Singly Linked Lists -- Is Palindrome
    A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forward and backwards.

    Example:
            R
            A
            C
            E
            C
            A
            R

    RACEDAR can be same when read forward and backwards so this will return True.

    Example:
            H
            E
            L
            L
            O

    Singly Linked Lists -- Move Tail to Head
    It will move the last node to head of the Singly Linked list.

    Example - singly LL is :
                            A
                            B
                            C
                            D
