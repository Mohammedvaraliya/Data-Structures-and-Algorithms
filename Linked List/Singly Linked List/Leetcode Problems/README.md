# Singly Liked List Data-Structures and Algorithms

## 01. Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

```bash
Singly Linked Lists -- Reverse
It will reversed the Singly Linked List

Example:
        "A"
        "B"
        "C"
        "D"
        "E"

reversed_list :
                "E"
                "D"
                "C"
                "B"
                "A"

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## 02. Singly Linked Lists -- Merge Two Sorted Lists

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

```bash
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## 03. Singly Linked Lists -- Reorder List

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

```bash
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

## 04. Singly Linked Lists -- Remove Nth Node From End of List

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

```bash
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

## 05. Singly Linked Lists -- Linked List Cycle

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

```bash
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

Example 3:
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## 06. Singly Linked Lists -- Merge k Sorted Lists

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

```bash
You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Example 1:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Example 2:
Input: lists = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```
