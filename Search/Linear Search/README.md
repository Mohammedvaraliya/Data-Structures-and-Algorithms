# Linear Search Data-Structures and Algorithms

## 01. Linear Search

    Linear Search
    Linear search is a very simple search algorithm.
    In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one.

## 02. Linear Search : Find Elements

    Linear Search : Find Elements
    You can use linear search if the array or list is not sorted.

    Example:
            array : [2, 4, 3, 15, 12, 87, 55]

    The above array is not sorted i.e(its not in ascending order)

    Suppose i have to find the target element from the array.

            target = 15

    So, i have to check the target element from the start of the array to end.

    target element is present at index number 3.

    hence, this traversing is called Linear Search.
