## 01. Rotate Image

[Leetcode Problem URL](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/)

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:
![matrix 1](assets/mat1.jpg)

```bash
Input: matrix = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]
]

Output: [
    [7,4,1],
    [8,5,2],
    [9,6,3]
]
```

Example 2:
![matrix 2](assets/mat2.jpg)

```bash
Input: matrix = [
    [5,1,9,11],
    [2,4,8,10],
    [13,3,6,7],
    [15,14,12,16]
]

Output: [
    [15,13,2,5],
    [14,3,4,1],
    [12,6,8,9],
    [16,7,10,11]
]
```

Example 3:
![matrix 3](assets/mat3.avif)

```bash
Input: matrix = [
    [1,2],
    [3,4]
]

Output: [
    [3,1],
    [4,2]
]
```

### Explanation

To rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place, we can use a **layer-by-layer rotation** approach. This involves rotating the matrix in layers, starting from the outermost layer and moving inward.

#### Why This Approach?

1. **In-Place Rotation**: The problem requires modifying the matrix in-place, so we cannot use extra space for another matrix. This approach ensures that we only use constant extra space.

2. **Efficient and Intuitive**: By rotating the matrix layer by layer, we can systematically handle each element without complex calculations.

3. **Scalable**: This approach works efficiently for matrices of any size `n x n`.

#### Steps

1. Step 1: Understand the Layers

   - For an `n x n` matrix, there are `n//2` layers. For example:
   - A `3x3` matrix has 1 layer.
   - A `4x4` matrix has 2 layers.

2. Step 2: Rotate Each Layer

   - For each layer, perform a **four-way swap** of elements:

   1. Move the top-left element to the top-right position.
   2. Move the top-right element to the bottom-right position.
   3. Move the bottom-right element to the bottom-left position.
   4. Move the bottom-left element to the top-left position.

3. Step 3: Implement the Rotation

   - Use two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to track the boundaries of the current layer.
   - For each layer, iterate through the elements and perform the four-way swap.

#### Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s walk through **Example 1** step by step:

1. **Input**: `matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`

1. **Initialize**:

   - `l = 0`, `r = 2` (since the matrix is `3x3`).

1. **Rotate the Outer Layer**:

   - **First Iteration** (`i = 0`):
     - Save the top-left element: `topLeft = matrix[0][0] = 1`.
     - Move bottom-left to top-left: `matrix[0][0] = matrix[2][0] = 7`.
     - Move bottom-right to bottom-left: `matrix[2][0] = matrix[2][2] = 9`.
     - Move top-right to bottom-right: `matrix[2][2] = matrix[0][2] = 3`.
     - Move saved top-left to top-right: `matrix[0][2] = topLeft = 1`.
     - Updated matrix:
       ```
       [7,2,1],
       [4,5,6],
       [9,8,3]
       ```
   - **Second Iteration** (`i = 1`):
     - Save the top-middle element: `topLeft = matrix[0][1] = 2`.
     - Move bottom-middle to top-middle: `matrix[0][1] = matrix[1][0] = 4`.
     - Move bottom-right-middle to bottom-middle: `matrix[1][0] = matrix[2][1] = 8`.
     - Move top-right-middle to bottom-right-middle: `matrix[2][1] = matrix[1][2] = 6`.
     - Move saved top-middle to top-right-middle: `matrix[1][2] = topLeft = 2`.
     - Updated matrix:
       ```
       [7,4,1],
       [8,5,2],
       [9,6,3]
       ```

1. **Result**:

   - The matrix is now rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

1. **Output**: `[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]`

#### Time and Space Complexity

1. Time Complexity

   - **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs for `n//2` layers.
   - **Inner Loop**: For each layer, the inner loop runs for `n - 2*layer` elements.
   - **Overall Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$, where `n` is the size of the matrix.

2. Space Complexity

   - **In-Place Modification**: The algorithm uses only constant extra space.
   - **Overall Space Complexity**: `O(1)`.

#### Why This Approach is Efficient

1. **In-Place Rotation**: The algorithm modifies the matrix in-place, satisfying the problem's constraints.
2. **Layer-by-Layer Rotation**: By rotating the matrix layer by layer, the solution is intuitive and easy to implement.
3. **Optimal Time Complexity**: The time complexity of $O(n^2)$ is optimal for this problem since we must touch every element of the matrix.
